## WEEK 13-15: APPLE MCP INTEGRATION (PRIORITY 2)
*Focus: Native Apple App Control & Actuation*

### Apple MCP Overview
Apple MCP exposes native Apple applications (Messages, Notes, Contacts, Mail, Reminders, Calendar, Maps) through the Model Context Protocol. This enables Kenny to not just read data but actively control Apple applications.

**Key Capabilities Unlocked:**
- **Messages**: Send/read/schedule messages
- **Mail**: Send emails with attachments, search, draft management
- **Calendar**: Create/search events, meeting scheduling
- **Reminders**: Task management and notification
- **Contacts**: Lookup and management
- **Notes**: Content creation and search
- **Maps**: Location services and navigation

### Phase 1: Read-Only MCP Integration (Week 13)
*Conservative approach - information retrieval only*

#### Implementation Tasks
- **MCP Server Setup**: Install and configure apple-mcp Bun/Node server
- **Security Configuration**: Implement audit logging and permission controls
- **Read-Only Operations**: 
  - Contacts lookup and search
  - Calendar event search and availability checking
  - Mail search and thread analysis
  - Notes content search and retrieval
  - Reminders list access
- **Kenny Integration**: Connect MCP server to Kenny's tool registry
- **Testing Environment**: Dedicated macOS user/device for safe testing

#### Risk Mitigation
- Pin to specific apple-mcp commit/version for stability
- Comprehensive audit logging of all MCP operations
- Dry-run mode for testing without actual system changes
- Isolated test environment to prevent accidental system modifications

### Phase 2: Guarded Write Operations (Week 14)
*Controlled actuation with safety mechanisms*

#### Implementation Tasks
- **Confirmation System**: User approval required for all write operations
- **Safe Write Operations**:
  - Calendar event creation with confirmation prompts
  - Reminder creation and management
  - Mail draft creation (no automatic sending)
  - Contact updates with approval workflows
- **Safety Controls**:
  - Operation preview before execution
  - Undo/rollback capabilities where possible
  - Rate limiting and operation throttling
  - Allowlist/blocklist for sensitive operations

#### Safety Features
- **Preview Mode**: Show exactly what will be modified before execution
- **Confirmation Prompts**: Explicit user approval for every write action
- **Operation Logging**: Detailed audit trail of all modifications
- **Emergency Stop**: Ability to immediately halt all MCP operations

### Phase 3: Advanced Actuation (Week 15)
*Full capabilities with paranoid safety controls*

#### High-Risk Operations
- **Messages**: Send text messages with strict confirmation requirements
- **Mail**: Send emails with recipient allowlists and content review
- **Advanced Calendar**: Meeting scheduling with automatic invitations
- **System Integration**: Cross-app workflows and automation

#### Advanced Safety Systems
- **Recipient Allowlists**: Pre-approved contacts for message/email sending
- **Content Review**: AI-powered content analysis before sending
- **Time-Based Restrictions**: Limit operations to business hours
- **Emergency Contacts**: Notification system for critical operations
- **Rollback Database**: Track changes for potential reversal

### Architecture Integration
- **Complementary Design**: MCP handles actuation, Kenny's Swift code handles ingestion
- **Protocol Unification**: Single interface for both read and write operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient MCP server communication
- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics for MCP operations

### Expected Deliverables
- **Phase 1**: Secure read-only access to all Apple apps through Kenny
- **Phase 2**: Controlled write operations with comprehensive safety systems
- **Phase 3**: Full native app control with paranoid security measures
- **Documentation**: Complete implementation guide and safety protocols
- **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage for all MCP operations
