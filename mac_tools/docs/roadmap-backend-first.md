# Kenny Backend-First Strategic Roadmap

## ✅ STATUS: COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY (August 27, 2025)

**All backend intelligence goals achieved. Ready for frontend development phase.**

## Strategic Philosophy: Intelligence Before Interface

**Core Principle**: Validate backend intelligence capabilities through CLI before investing in frontend development. This approach ensures the assistant actually works before building user-facing interfaces.

**RESULT**: Strategy validated. Backend intelligence is world-class and production-ready.

## WEEK 8: BACKEND INTELLIGENCE (PRIORITY 1)
*Focus: Making Kenny Actually Intelligent via CLI*

### Semantic Search Implementation
- **Vector Embeddings**: Implement local sentence transformers for semantic similarity
- **Hybrid Search**: Combine BM25 (keyword) with vector similarity for better results
- **Query Understanding**: Parse natural language queries into structured searches
- **Cross-Reference Engine**: Link related content across data sources (messages mentioning calendar events, emails from contacts, etc.)

### Natural Language Query Processing
- **Query Intent Classification**: Understand search intent (find, summarize, create, etc.)
- **Entity Recognition**: Extract names, dates, locations from natural language queries
- **Query Expansion**: Automatically expand queries with synonyms and related terms
- **Context Awareness**: Use conversation history to improve query understanding

### Action Capabilities
- **Email Draft Generation**: Create email drafts based on context and intent
- **Calendar Event Creation**: Parse "schedule meeting with John next Tuesday" into calendar events  
- **Contact Management**: Add/update contact information from parsed content
- **Task Extraction**: Identify actionable items from messages and emails
- **Smart Responses**: Generate contextually appropriate message replies

### Intelligence Validation (CLI Testing)
- **Query Complexity Tests**: Handle multi-step queries like "Find emails from Sarah about the project and create a summary"
- **Cross-Source Correlation**: "Show me all communication with contacts who have meetings this week"
- **Temporal Reasoning**: "What did I discuss with clients before the board meeting last month?"
- **Action Execution**: Verify draft generation, calendar creation, contact updates work correctly

### Expected Deliverables
- Local semantic search with 90%+ relevance for test queries
- Natural language query parser handling complex requests
- Working action system for emails, calendar, contacts
- CLI commands demonstrating cross-source intelligence
- Performance benchmarks showing <500ms query response times

## WEEK 9: DATA COMPLETENESS & REAL-TIME SYNC (PRIORITY 2)  
*Focus: Complete Data Foundation*

### Additional Data Source Ingestion
- **Safari History & Bookmarks**: Full browsing history with content indexing
- **Notes App**: Complete notes content with rich text support
- **Reminders**: Task lists with due dates and categories
- **Files**: Document content indexing (PDF, Word, text files)
- **Photos Metadata**: EXIF data, location, people tags (not image content)

### Content Processing Enhancement
- **Document Text Extraction**: PDF, DOCX, TXT content indexing
- **Rich Text Support**: Handle Notes app formatting, HTML content
- **Attachment Processing**: Extract text from email/message attachments
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Enhanced file metadata, creation dates, modification tracking

### Real-Time Incremental Updates
- **File System Watchers**: Detect new messages, emails, calendar events
- **Change Detection**: Identify modified content for re-indexing
- **Delta Processing**: Process only changed data instead of full re-ingestion
- **Background Sync**: Continuous updates without blocking user operations

### Data Quality & Validation
- **Content Verification**: Ensure all ingested items have meaningful content
- **Duplicate Detection**: Advanced deduplication across data sources
- **Data Completeness Audit**: Verify all accessible data is properly indexed
- **Search Result Quality**: Validate search returns relevant, complete results

### Expected Deliverables
- Complete data ingestion for all major macOS data sources
- Real-time sync maintaining data freshness
- Validated data quality with comprehensive coverage
- Performance metrics for incremental update processing

## WEEK 10: PRODUCTION CLI OPTIMIZATION (PRIORITY 3)
*Focus: Polishing CLI for Power Users*

### Performance Optimization
- **Query Performance**: Sub-100ms search response times
- **Index Optimization**: Efficient FTS5 and vector index management
- **Memory Management**: Optimized memory usage for large datasets
- **Concurrent Processing**: Parallel query execution and data processing

### Reliability & Error Handling
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation when data sources are unavailable
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from indexing failures
- **Data Corruption Protection**: Checksums and integrity validation
- **Robust Permission Handling**: Graceful handling of denied system access

### Advanced CLI Features
- **Interactive Mode**: Conversational CLI interface for complex queries
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple queries or actions efficiently
- **Export Capabilities**: Export search results in various formats (JSON, CSV, markdown)
- **Plugin Architecture**: Framework for extending functionality

### Monitoring & Analytics  
- **Performance Metrics**: Query latency, index size, processing times
- **Usage Analytics**: Track command usage patterns and optimization opportunities
- **Health Monitoring**: System health checks and diagnostic commands
- **Debug Tools**: Advanced debugging and troubleshooting capabilities

### Documentation & Onboarding
- **Power User Guide**: Comprehensive CLI documentation
- **Query Examples**: Library of complex query patterns and use cases
- **Performance Tuning**: Guidelines for optimizing Kenny for specific workflows
- **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and resolution steps

### Expected Deliverables
- Production-ready CLI with <100ms query performance
- Comprehensive error handling and fault tolerance
- Advanced features enabling power user workflows
- Complete documentation and user onboarding materials
