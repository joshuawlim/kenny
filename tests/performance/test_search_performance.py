Performance tests for search algorithms and threshold optimization

Tests performance characteristics of:
1. Fuzzy contact matching at scale
2. Search threshold progressive fallback performance  
3. Cross-platform search coordination overhead
4. Database query optimization effectiveness

These tests ensure fixes don't introduce performance regressions.
